Building a quiz game using JS which will run in the console

Rules and Requirements :

1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
   a) question itself
   b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object etc.)
   c) correct answer (I would use a number for this)

2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor

3. Store them all inside an array

4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this task).

5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer.

6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not.

7. Make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code.

8. After you display the result, display the next random question, so that the game never ends.

9. After Task 8, the game literally never ends. So include the option to quit the game if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer. In this case, DON'T call the function from task 8.

10. Track the user's score to make the game more fun! So each time an answer is correct, add 1 point to the score.

11. Display the score in the console. Use yet another method for this.
